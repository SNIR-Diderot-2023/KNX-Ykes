# KNX-Ykes
I'm a student at Diderot High School in Paris, France. I'm currently in my second year of a "BTS SNIR" (Brevet de Technicien Supérieur in "Systèmes Numériques Informatiques et Réseaux"). This is the code for the KNX project for my second year project at Diderot High School.

It is a project that aims to create an electronic card, that's attached to a KNX bus and that can be used collect data from the bus and send it to a server.
The server will then be able to display the data in a web interface.

## Installation
### Python
for the python version, you need to install the following libraries:
- pyserial
- bitstring

### C++
for the C++ version, you need to install the following libraries:
- All standard C++ libraries, espesially boost asio.

## Usage
### Python
well for the python version there is no cli since I wasn't in charge of the user interface.
Good luck with that.

### C++
you may need to recompile the code.
Just deal with it.(I used cmake and vscode)

as for the usage:
start the script
select the port and that's it.

make sure to create the database before starting the script.

also there is a php web interface that you can use to display the data.
